TI  - Clinical impact of the NKp30/B7-H6 axis in high-risk neuroblastoma patients.
PG  - 283ra55
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaa2327 [doi]
AB  - The immunosurveillance mechanisms governing high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB), a
      major pediatric malignancy, have been elusive. We identify a potential role for
      natural killer (NK) cells, in particular the interaction between the NK receptor 
      NKp30 and its ligand, B7-H6, in the metastatic progression and survival of HR-NB 
      after myeloablative multimodal chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. NB
      cells expressing the NKp30 ligand B7-H6 stimulated NK cells in an NKp30-dependent
      manner. Serum concentration of soluble B7-H6 correlated with the down-regulation 
      of NKp30, bone marrow metastases, and chemoresistance, and soluble B7-H6
      contained in the serum of HR-NB patients inhibited NK cell functions in vitro.
      The expression of distinct NKp30 isoforms affecting the polarization of NK cell
      functions correlated with 10-year event-free survival in three independent
      cohorts of HR-NB in remission from metastases after induction chemotherapy (n =
      196, P < 0.001), adding prognostic value to known risk factors such as N-Myc
      amplification and age >18 months. We conclude that the interaction between NKp30 
      and B7-H6 may contribute to the fate of NB patients and that both the expression 
      of NKp30 isoforms on circulating NK cells and the concentration of soluble B7-H6 
      in the serum may be clinically useful as biomarkers for risk stratification.

TI  - Impact of centralization on aCGH-based genomic profiles for precision medicine in
      oncology.
PG  - 582-8
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mdu582 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays are increasingly used 
      in personalized medicine programs to identify gene copy number aberrations (CNAs)
      that may be used to guide clinical decisions made during molecular tumor boards. 
      However, analytical processes such as the centralization step may profoundly
      affect CGH array results and therefore may adversely affect outcomes in the
      precision medicine context. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The effect of three different
      centralization methods: median, maximum peak, alternative peak, were evaluated on
      three datasets: (i) the NCI60 cell lines panel, (ii) the Cancer Cell Line
      Encyclopedia (CCLE) panel, and (iii) the patients enrolled in prospective
      molecular screening trials (SAFIR-01 n = 283, MOSCATO-01 n = 309), and compared
      with karyotyping, drug sensitivity, and patient-drug matching, respectively.
      RESULTS: Using the NCI60 cell lines panel, the profiles generated by the
      alternative peak method were significantly closer to the cell karyotypes than
      those generated by the other centralization strategies (P < 0.05). Using the CCLE
      dataset, selected genes (ERBB2, EGFR) were better or equally correlated to the
      IC50 of their companion drug (lapatinib, erlotinib), when applying the
      alternative centralization. Finally, focusing on 24 actionable genes, we observed
      as many as 7.1% (SAFIR-01) and 6.8% (MOSCATO-01) of patients originally not
      oriented to a specific treatment, but who could have been proposed a treatment
      based on the alternative peak centralization method. CONCLUSION: The
      centralization method substantially affects the call detection of CGH profiles
      and may thus impact precision medicine approaches. Among the three methods
      described, the alternative peak method addresses limitations associated with
      existing approaches.

TI  - Chk1 as a new therapeutic target in triple-negative breast cancer.
PG  - 250-8
LID - 10.1016/j.breast.2014.02.004 [doi]
LID - S0960-9776(14)00032-0 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bioinformatics analyses of pathways and genes differentially
      expressed between malignant and benign lesions could allow discovering new
      therapeutic targets. Here, we identified Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) as a potent
      therapeutic target in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Differential gene expression between TNBC, other malignant and benign
      lesions was performed on two breast cancer datasets. Chk1 was targeted using RNA 
      interference or chemical inhibitor in several TNBC cell lines. RESULTS: DNA
      repair pathway was identified as one mostly deregulated pathway in TNBC as
      compared to benign lesions. Chk1 was identified as candidate target among the 35 
      genes included in this pathway. Gene expression analysis revealed that Chk1 gene 
      was significantly overexpressed in TNBC as compared to non-TNBC and benign
      lesions. Depletion of Chk1 protein expression induced a marked reduction of cell 
      viability and led to mitotic catastrophe in TNBC cells. Chemical Chk1 inhibitor
      decreased survival in TNBC cells, and transcriptome analyze revealed a modulation
      of gene expression profile in response to Chk1 treatment. CONCLUSION: These
      findings suggest that Chk1 may represent a therapeutic target in TNBC, and
      provide a rationale to evaluate Chk1 inhibitors in breast cancer patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is characterised by genomic alterations. We did a
      multicentre molecular screening study to identify abnormalities in individual
      patients with the aim of providing targeted therapy matched to individuals'
      genomic alterations. METHODS: From June 16, 2011, to July 30, 2012, we recruited 
      patients who had breast cancer with a metastasis accessible for biopsy in 18
      centres in France. Comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) array and Sanger
      sequencing on PIK3CA (exon 10 and 21) and AKT1 (exon 4) were used to assess
      metastatic biopsy samples in five centres. Therapeutic targets were decided on
      the basis of identified genomic alterations. The primary objective was to include
      30% of patients in clinical trials testing a targeted therapy and, therefore, the
      primary outcome was the proportion of patients to whom a targeted therapy could
      be offered. For the primary endpoint, the analyses were done on the overall
      population registered for the trial. This trial is registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01414933. FINDINGS: 423 patients were included, and
      biopsy samples were obtained from 407 (metastatic breast cancer was not found in 
      four). CGH array and Sanger sequencing were feasible in 283 (67%) and 297 (70%)
      patients, respectively. A targetable genomic alteration was identified in 195
      (46%) patients, most frequently in PIK3CA (74 [25%] of 297 identified genomic
      alterations), CCND1 (53 [19%]), and FGFR1 (36 [13%]). 117 (39%) of 297 patients
      with genomic tests available presented with rare genomic alterations (defined as 
      occurring in less than 5% of the general population), including AKT1 mutations,
      and EGFR, MDM2, FGFR2, AKT2, IGF1R, and MET high-level amplifications. Therapy
      could be personalised in 55 (13%) of 423 patients. Of the 43 patients who were
      assessable and received targeted therapy, four (9%) had an objective response,
      and nine others (21%) had stable disease for more than 16 weeks. Serious (grade 3
      or higher) adverse events related to biopsy were reported in four (1%) of
      enrolled patients, including pneumothorax (grade 3, one patient), pain (grade 3, 
      one patient), haematoma (grade 3, one patient), and haemorrhagic shock (grade 3, 
      one patient). INTERPRETATION: Personalisation of medicine for metastatic breast
      cancer is feasible, including for rare genomic alterations. FUNDING: French

      lung adenocarcinomas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In lung adenocarcinoma, inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 may 
      abrogate a safeguard mechanism preventing the development of tumors with
      activating mutations in EGFR or KRAS. To assess this hypothesis, we analyzed TP53
      mutations and downregulation of p14(arf), a negative regulator of p53 activated
      by oncogenic signals, in a retrospective series of 96 patients with primary
      adenocarcinoma of the lung. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mutations in TP53 (exons 4-9), 
      KRAS (exon 1), and EGFR (exons 18-21) were identified by direct sequencing of DNA
      from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded resected tumors. Expression of p14(arf)
      was semiquantitatively evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: TP53, 
      KRAS, and EGFR mutations were detected in 42 of 93 (45.2%), 15 of 95 (15.8%), and
      31 of 90 (34.4%) cases, respectively. Low p14(arf) expression was observed in 19 
      of 91 cases (20.9%). Disruption of the p53/p14(arf) pathway (defined as TP53
      mutation or decreased p14(arf) expression, or both) was observed in 18 of 31
      EGFR-mutated (58.1%) tumors and in 9 of 13 KRAS-mutated (69.2%) tumors.
      CONCLUSION: Inactivation of the p53/p14(arf) pathway is common but not systematic
      in EGFR- or KRAS-mutated lung adenocarcinomas. Our work highlights the need to
      better investigate the association between EGFR and KRAS mutations and
      alterations in tumor suppressor pathways.

TI  - Targeting CDC25C, PLK1 and CHEK1 to overcome Docetaxel resistance induced by loss
      of LZTS1 in prostate cancer.
PG  - 667-78
AB  - Docetaxel is used as a standard treatment in patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, a large subset of patients
      develops resistance. Understanding resistance mechanisms, which are largely
      unknown, will allow identification of predictive biomarkers and therapeutic
      targets. We established resistant IGR-CaP1 prostate cancer cell lines for
      different doses of Docetaxel. We investigated gene expression profiles by
      microarray analyses in these cell lines and generated a signature of 99 highly
      differentially expressed genes potentially implicated in chemoresistance. We
      focused on the role of the cell cycle regulator LZTS1, which was under-expressed 
      in the Docetaxel-resistant cell lines, its inhibition resulting from the promoter
      methylation. Knockdown of LZTS1 in parental cells with siRNA showed that LZTS1
      plays a role in the acquisition of the resistant phenotype. Furthermore, we
      observed that targeting CDC25C, a partner of LZTS1, with the NSC663284 inhibitor 
      specifically killed the Docetaxel-resistant cells. To further investigate the
      role of CDC25C, we used inhibitors of the mitotic kinases that regulate CDC25C.
      Inhibition of CHEK1 and PLK1 induced growth arrest and cell death in the
      resistant cells. Our findings identify an important role of LZTS1 through its
      regulation of CDC25C in Docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer and suggest that 
      CDC25C, or the mitotic kinases CHEK1 and PLK1, could be efficient therapeutic
      targets to overcome Docetaxel resistance.

TI  - Changes in signaling pathways induced by vandetanib in a human medullary thyroid 
      carcinoma model, as analyzed by reverse phase protein array.
PG  - 43-51
LID - 10.1089/thy.2013.0514 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare tumor that is caused by
      activating mutations in the proto-oncogene RET. Vandetanib, a tyrosine-kinase
      inhibitor, has been recently approved to treat adult patients with metastatic
      MTC. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in signaling pathways
      induced by vandetanib treatment in preclinical MTC models, using the
      reverse-phase protein array method (RPPA). METHODS: The human TT cell line was
      used to assess in vitro and in vivo activity of vandetanib. Protein extracts from
      TT cells or TT xenografted mice, treated by increasing concentrations of
      vandetanib for different periods of time, were probed with a set of 12 antibodies
      representing major signaling pathways, using RPPA. Results were validated using
      two distinct protein detection methods: Western immunoblotting and
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Vandetanib displays antiproliferative and
      antiangiogenic activities and inhibits RET autophosphorylation. The MAPK and AKT 
      pathways were the two major signaling pathways inhibited by vandetanib.
      Interestingly, phosphorylated levels of NFkappaB-p65 were significantly increased
      by vandetanib. Comparable results were obtained in both the in vitro and in vivo 
      approaches, as well as for the protein detection methods. However, some
      discrepancies were observed between RPPA and Western immunoblotting, possibly due
      to lack of specificity of the primary antibodies used. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our 
      results confirmed the interest of RPPA for screening global changes induced in
      signaling pathways by kinase inhibitors. MAPK and AKT were identified as the main
      pathways involved in vandetanib response in MTC models. Our results also suggest 
      alternative routes for controlling the disease, and provide a rationale for the
      development of therapeutic combinations based on the comprehensive identification
      of molecular events induced by inhibitors.

TI  - ERCC1 function in nuclear excision and interstrand crosslink repair pathways is
      mediated exclusively by the ERCC1-202 isoform.
PG  - 3298-306
LID - 10.4161/cc.26309 [doi]
AB  - ERCC1 (excision repair cross-complementation group 1) plays essential roles in
      the removal of DNA intrastrand crosslinks by nucleotide excision repair, and that
      of DNA interstrand crosslinks by the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway and
      homology-directed repair processes (HDR). The function of ERCC1 thus impacts on
      the DNA damage response (DDR), particularly in anticancer therapy when DNA
      damaging agents are employed. ERCC1 expression has been proposed as a predictive 
      biomarker of the response to platinum-based therapy. However, the assessment of
      ERCC1 expression in clinical samples is complicated by the existence of 4
      functionally distinct protein isoforms, which differently impact on DDR. Here, we
      explored the functional competence of each ERCC1 protein isoform and obtained
      evidence that the 202 isoform is the sole one endowed with ERCC1 activity in DNA 
      repair pathways. The ERCC1 isoform 202 interacts with RPA, XPA, and XPF, and XPF 
      stability requires expression of the ERCC1 202 isoform (but none of the 3
      others). ERCC1-deficient non-small cell lung cancer cells show abnormal mitosis, 
      a phenotype reminiscent of the FA phenotype that can be rescued by isoform 202
      only. Finally, we could not observe any dominant-negative interaction between
      ERCC1 isoforms. These data suggest that the selective assessment of the ERCC1
      isoform 202 in clinical samples should accurately reflect the DDR-related
      activity of the gene and hence constitute a useful biomarker for customizing
      anticancer therapies.

TI  - Retinoic acid receptor alpha amplifications and retinoic acid sensitivity in
      breast cancers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular segmentation of breast cancer allows identification of
      small groups of patients who present high sensitivity to targeted agents. A
      patient, with chemo- and trastuzumab-resistant HER2-overexpressing breast cancer,
      who presented concomitant acute promyelocytic leukemia, showed a response in her 
      breast lesions to retinoic acid, arsenic, and aracytin. We therefore investigated
      whether RARA gene amplification could be associated with sensitivity to retinoic 
      acid derivatives in breast cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Array comparative
      genomic hybridization and gene expression arrays were used to characterize RARA
      amplifications and expression in 103 breast cancer samples. In vitro activity of 
      ATRA was characterized in T47D, SKBR3, and BT474 cell lines. RESULTS: Retinoic
      acid receptor alpha was gained or amplified in 27% of HER2-positive and 13% of
      HER2-negative breast cancer samples. Retinoic acid receptor alpha can be
      coamplified with HER2. Retinoic acid receptor alpha copy number changes could be 
      correlated with messenger RNA expression. All-trans-retinoic acid reduced cell
      viability of RARA-amplified, but not RARA-normal, cell lines through apoptosis.
      Gene expression arrays showed that ATRA-induced apoptosis in RARA-amplified cell 
      lines was related to an increase in CASP1 and IRF1. CONCLUSION: The results of
      this study suggest that breast cancers exhibiting RARA amplifications could be
      sensitive to retinoic acid. A phase II trial will evaluate this hypothesis in the
      clinical setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Excision repair cross complementing 1 gene expression level has
      potential as a prognostic and predictive marker of the efficacy of chemotherapy
      in NSCLC. The effect of ERCC1 gene copy number (CN) variation (CNV) on ERCC1
      expression and the clinical outcome of patients with NSCLC are not known.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Copy number variation of the 19q13.3 region carrying the
      ERCC1 gene, classified as gene amplification (GA) or high polysomy (HP), was
      evaluated on 235 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumors from resected NSCLC 
      patient samples and 16 NSCLC cell lines using FISH. We analyzed the potential
      correlations between FISH status and ERCC1 expression, patient's outcome, and
      cisplatin sensitivity in the cohort or cell lines. RESULTS: An increase of
      19q13.3 gene CN was detected in 60 cases (25.5%) including 27 cases with GA and
      33 cases with HP. A nonsignificant trend for higher ERCC1 expression in HP
      patients compared with GA and patients with low CNV was found (P = .06). In
      patients not treated with chemotherapy, FISH negative status cases had longer
      disease-free survival (DFS) compared with patients with 19q13-ERCC1 GA (P = .02).
      A 3-fold increase in IC50 of cisplatin in cell lines with high 19q13-ERCC1 CN
      compared with cells without CNV was shown. CONCLUSION: ERCC1 CN increase assessed
      using FISH did not determine ERCC1 expression status but yields potential
      prognostic information on DFS in untreated patients with NSCLC. The clinical
      relevance of an association of 19q13-ERCC1 FISH status and chemosensitivity or
      prognosis in patients needs further investigation and validation.

LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3937 [doi]
AB  - The progressive introduction of high-throughput molecular techniques in the
      clinic allows for the extensive and systematic exploration of multiple biologic
      layers of tumors. Molecular profiles and classifiers generated from these assays 
      represent the foundation of what the National Academy describes as the future of 
      "precision medicine". However, the analysis of such complex data requires the
      implementation of sophisticated bioinformatic and statistical procedures. It is
      critical that oncology practitioners be aware of the advantages and limitations
      of the methods used to generate classifiers to usher them into the clinic. This
      article uses publicly available expression data from patients with non-small cell
      lung cancer to first illustrate the challenges of experimental design and
      preprocessing of data before clinical application and highlights the challenges
      of high-dimensional statistical analysis. It provides a roadmap for the
      translation of such classifiers to clinical practice and makes key
      recommendations for good practice.

TI  - Changes in signaling pathways induced by vandetanib in a human medullary thyroid 
      carcinoma model, as analyzed by reverse phase protein array.
LID - 10.1089/thy.2012.0224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare tumor that is due to
      activating mutations in the proto-oncogene RET. Vandetanib, a tyrosine-kinase
      inhibitor, has been recently approved to treat adult patients with metastatic
      MTC. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in signaling pathways
      induced by vandetanib treatment in preclinical MTC models, using the
      reverse-phase protein array method (RPPA). METHODS: The human TT cell line was
      used to assess in vitro and in vivo activity of vandetanib. Protein extracts from
      TT cells or TT xenografted mice, treated by increasing concentrations of
      vandetanib for different periods of time, were probed with a set of 12 antibodies
      representing major signaling pathways, using RPPA. Results were validated using
      two distinct protein detection methods, western-immunoblotting and
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Vandetanib displays antiproliferative and
      antiangiogenic activities and inhibits RET auto-phosphorylation. MAPK and AKT
      pathways were the two major signaling pathways inhibited by vandetanib.
      Interestingly, phosphorylated levels of NFkappaB-p65 were significantly increased
      by vandetanib. Comparable results were obtained in both the in vitro and in vivo 
      approaches as well as for the protein detection methods, although some
      discrepancies were observed between RPPA and western-immunoblotting. CONCLUSIONS:
      Results confirmed the reliability and the utility of RPPA for screening global
      changes induced in signaling pathways by kinase inhibitors. MAPK and AKT were
      identified as the main pathways involved in vandetanib response in MTC models.
      Our results also suggest alternative routes for controlling the disease and
      provide a rationale for the development of therapeutic combinations based on the 
      comprehensive identification of molecular events induced by inhibitors.

AB  - Insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGF-1R) inhibition could be a relevant
      therapeutic approach in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) given the importance of an 
      IGF-1R autocrine loop and its role in DNA damage repair processes. We assessed
      IGF-1R and pAkt protein expression in 83 SCLC human specimens. The efficacy of
      R1507 (a monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-1R) alone or combined with
      cisplatin or ionizing radiation (IR) was evaluated in H69, H146, and H526 cells
      in vitro and in vivo. Innovative genomic and functional approaches were conducted
      to analyze the molecular behavior under the different treatment conditions. A
      total of 53% and 37% of human specimens expressed IGF-1R and pAkt, respectively. 
      R1507 showed single-agent activity in H146 and H526 cells but not in H69 cells.
      R1507 exhibited synergistic effects with both cisplatin and IR in vitro. The
      triple combination R1507-cisplatin-IR led to a dramatic delay in tumor growth
      compared with cisplatin-IR in H526 cells. Analyzing the apparent absence of
      antitumoral effect of R1507 alone in vivo, we observed a transient reduction of
      IGF-1R staining intensity in vivo, concomitant to the activation of multiple cell
      surface receptors and intracellular proteins involved in proliferation,
      angiogenesis, and survival. Finally, we identified that the nucleotide excision
      repair pathway was mediated after exposure to R1507-CDDP and R1507-IR in vitro
      and in vivo. In conclusion, adding R1507 to the current standard cisplatin-IR
      doublet reveals remarkable chemo- and radiosensitizing effects in selected SCLC
      models and warrants to be investigated in the clinical setting.

PG  - 3499-510

AB  - Cancer immunosurveillance relies on effector/memory tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T
      cells with a T-helper cell 1 (TH1) profile. Evidence for a natural killer (NK)
      cell-based control of human malignancies is still largely missing. The KIT
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate markedly prolongs the survival of
      patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) by direct effects on tumor
      cells as well as by indirect immunostimulatory effects on T and NK cells. Here,
      we investigated the prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)
      expressing CD3, Foxp3, or NKp46 (NCR1) in a cohort of patients with localized
      GIST. We found that CD3(+) TIL were highly activated in GIST and were especially 
      enriched in areas of the tumor that conserve class I MHC expression despite
      imatinib mesylate treatment. High densities of CD3(+) TIL predicted
      progression-free survival (PFS) in multivariate analyses. Moreover, GIST were
      infiltrated by a homogeneous subset of cytokine-secreting CD56(bright) (NCAM1) NK
      cells that accumulated in tumor foci after imatinib mesylate treatment. The
      density of the NK infiltrate independently predicted PFS and added prognostic
      information to the Miettinen score, as well as to the KIT mutational status. NK
      and T lymphocytes preferentially distributed to distinct areas of tumor sections 
      and probably contributed independently to GIST immunosurveillance. These findings
      encourage the prospective validation of immune biomarkers for optimal risk
      stratification of patients with GIST.

TI  - Next-generation sequencing reveals high concordance of recurrent somatic
      alterations between primary tumor and metastases from patients with
      non-small-cell lung cancer.

AB  - PURPOSE: Characterization of the genomic changes that drive an individual
      patient's disease is critical in management of many cancers. In patients with
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), obtaining tumor samples of sufficient size
      for genomic profiling on recurrence is often challenging. We undertook this study
      to compare genomic alterations identified in archived primary tumors from
      patients with NSCLC with those identified in metachronous or synchronous
      metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Primary and matched metastatic tumor pairs from
      15 patients were analyzed by using a targeted next-generation sequencing assay in
      a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments laboratory. Genomic libraries were
      captured for 3,230 exons in 182 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14
      genes often rearranged in cancer and sequenced to high coverage. RESULTS: Among
      30 tumors, 311 genomic alterations were identified of which 63 were known
      recurrent (32 in primary tumor, 31 in metastasis) and 248 were nonrecurrent
      (likely passenger). TP53 mutations were the most frequently observed recurrent
      alterations (12 patients). Tumors harbored two or more (maximum four) recurrent
      alterations in 10 patients. Comparative analysis of recurrent alterations between
      primary tumor and matched metastasis revealed a concordance rate of 94% compared 
      with 63% for likely passenger alterations. CONCLUSION: This high concordance
      suggests that for the purposes of genomic profiling, use of archived primary
      tumor can identify the key recurrent somatic alterations present in matched NSCLC
      metastases and may provide much of the relevant genomic information required to
      guide treatment on recurrence.

AB  - Evaluation of DNA repair proteins might provide meaningful information in
      relation to prognosis and chemotherapy efficacy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
      (NSCLC) patients. The role of Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) in DNA repair of
      platinum adducts has not been firmly established. We used a DNA repair functional
      test based on antibody recognition of cisplatin intrastrand platinum adducts on
      DNA. We evaluated the effect of PARP inhibition on DNA repair functionality in a 
      panel of cisplatin cell lines treated by the clinical-grade pharmacological
      inhibitor CEP8983 (a 4-methoxy-carbazole derivate) and the commercially available
      inhibitor PJ34 (phenanthridinone). We determined PARP1 protein expression in
      whole tumor sections from the International Adjuvant Lung cancer Trial (IALT)-bio
      study and tested a 3-marker PARP1/MSH2/ERCC1 algorithm combining PARP1 tumor
      status with previously published data. Chemosensitivity of cisplatin in NSCLC
      cell lines was correlated with the accumulation of cisplatin DNA adducts
      (P=0.0004). Further, the pharmacological inhibition of PARP induced a 1.7 to
      2.3-fold increase in platinum adduct accumulation (24h) in A549 cell line
      suggesting a slow-down of platinum DNA-adduct repair capacity. In parallel, PARP1
      inhibition increased the sensitivity to cisplatin treatment. In patient samples, 
      PARP1 expression levels did not influence patient survival or the effect of
      platinum-based post-operative chemotherapy in the global IALT-bio population
      (interaction P=0.79). Among cases with high expression of all three markers
      (triple positive), untreated patients had prolonged survival with a median DFS of
      7.8 years, (HR=0.34, 95%CI [0.19-0.61], adjusted P=0.0003) compared to triple
      negative patients (1.4 years). Remarkably, triple positive patients suffered from
      a detrimental effect (4.9-year reduction of median DFS) by post-operative
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy (HR=1.79, 95%CI [1.01-3.17], adjusted P=0.04,
      chemotherapy vs. control). Combinatorial sub-group analysis of the 3 markers
      further suggested that PARP1 tumor positivity might constitute a molecular
      context with high theranostic interest of ERCC1 and MSH2 in NSCLC. In conclusion,
      our data confirm that platinum DNA adduct accumulation is linked to
      chemosensitivity, which increase by pharmacological PARP inhibitors points to a
      role of PARP-dependent DNA repair in the process. We further suggest DNA repair
      biomarkers should be analyzed in a larger context of multiple DNA repair pathway 
      regulation.

      mTOR blockade and autophagy.

AB  - The spliceosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex that guides pre-mRNA
      splicing in eukaryotic cells. Here, we determine whether the spliceosome could
      constitute an attractive therapeutic target in cancer. Analysis of gene
      expression arrays from lung, breast, and ovarian cancers datasets revealed that
      several genes encoding components of the core spliceosome composed of a
      heteroheptameric Sm complex were overexpressed in malignant disease as compared
      with benign lesions and could also define a subset of highly aggressive breast
      cancers. siRNA-mediated depletion of SmE (SNRPE) or SmD1 (SNRPD1) led to a marked
      reduction of cell viability in breast, lung, and melanoma cancer cell lines,
      whereas it had little effect on the survival of the nonmalignant MCF-10A breast
      epithelial cells. SNRPE or SNRPD1 depletion did not lead to apoptotic cell death 
      but autophagy, another form of cell death. Indeed, induction of autophagy was
      revealed by cytoplasmic accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and by an increase in
      both LC3 (MAP1LC3A) protein conversion and the amount of acidic autophagic
      vacuoles. Knockdown of SNRPE dramatically decreased mTOR mRNA and protein levels 
      and was accompanied by a deregulation of the mTOR pathway, which, in part,
      explains the SNRPE-dependent induction of autophagy. These findings provide a
      rational to develop new therapeutic agents targeting spliceosome core components 
      in oncology.

PG  - 1101-10
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1214271 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) protein is 
      a potential prognostic biomarker of the efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy 
      in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although several ongoing trials are
      evaluating the level of expression of ERCC1, no consensus has been reached
      regarding a method for evaluation. METHODS: We used the 8F1 antibody to measure
      the level of expression of ERCC1 protein by means of immunohistochemical analysis
      in a validation set of samples obtained from 494 patients in two independent
      phase 3 trials (the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group
      JBR.10 and the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9633 trial from the Lung Adjuvant
      Cisplatin Evaluation Biology project). We compared the results of repeated
      staining of the entire original set of samples obtained from 589 patients in the 
      International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial Biology study, which had led to the
      initial correlation between the absence of ERCC1 expression and platinum
      response, with our previous results in the same tumors. We mapped the epitope
      recognized by 16 commercially available ERCC1 antibodies and investigated the
      capacity of the different ERCC1 isoforms to repair platinum-induced DNA damage.
      RESULTS: We were unable to validate the predictive effect of immunostaining for
      ERCC1 protein. The discordance in the results of staining for ERCC1 suggested a
      change in the performance of the 8F1 antibody since 2006. We found that none of
      the 16 antibodies could distinguish among the four ERCC1 protein isoforms,
      whereas only one isoform produced a protein that had full capacities for
      nucleotide excision repair and cisplatin resistance. CONCLUSIONS:
      Immunohistochemical analysis with the use of currently available ERCC1 antibodies
      did not specifically detect the unique functional ERCC1 isoform. As a result, its
      usefulness in guiding therapeutic decision making is limited. (Funded by Eli
      Lilly and others.).

TI  - Analysis of NKp30/NCR3 isoforms in untreated HIV-1-infected patients from the
      ANRS SEROCO cohort.
PG  - e23472
AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells play a prominent role at the intersection between
      innate and cognate immunity, thus influencing the development of multiple
      pathological conditions including HIV-1-induced AIDS. Not only NK cells directly 
      kill HIV-1-infected cells, but also control the maturation and/or elimination of 
      dendritic cells (DCs). These functions are regulated by the delicate balance
      between activating and inhibiting receptors expressed at the NK-cell surface.
      Among the former, NKp30 has raised significant interest since the alternative
      splicing of its intracellular domain leads to differential effector functions,
      dictating the prognosis of patients bearing gastrointestinal sarcoma, and B7-H6
      has recently been identified as its main ligand. Since NKp30 is downregulated in 
      CD56-/CD16+ NK cells expanded in viremic, chronically infected HIV-1+ patients,
      we decided to investigate the predictive value of NKp30 splice variants for
      spontaneous disease progression in 89 therapy-naive HIV-1-infected individuals
      enrolled in an historical cohort of patients followed since diagnosis (ANRS
      SEROCO cohort). We found no difference in the representation of NK-cell subsets
      (CD56bright, CD56dim, CD56neg) in HIV-1-infected patients as compared with
      healthy subjects. NKp30 downregulation was detected in CD56dim and CD56neg
      NK-cell subsets, yet this did not convey any prognostic value. None of the NKp30 
      isoforms did affect disease progression, as measured in terms of time-to-loss of 
      circulating CD4+ T cells, time-to-AIDS-defining events and overall survival.
      NKp30 isoforms do not seem to play a major role in the outcome of HIV-1
      infection, but the heterogeneity of the immuno-virological status of patients at 
      enrollment could have to be taken into account.

AB  - Breast cancer includes high number of molecular entities targetable by specific
      agents. In this study, array CGH and PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations were used to drive
      patients into targeted therapy. A prospective molecular analysis was offered to
      metastatic breast cancer patients for whom samples were collected prospectively
      or retrospectively either from frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue. Analyses were 
      performed using array CGH (Agilent platform) and PIK3CA (exon 10 and 21) and AKT1
      mutations were explored by standard Sanger sequencing. One hundred and eight
      patients were included. Good quality CGH was obtained in 79% cases and was better
      for frozen samples. Genomic alterations were identified in 50% of patients
      including 11 PIK3CA and 8 AKT1 mutations. Eighteen treatments (17 patients) were 
      administered according to their molecular profile with evidence of activity in
      nine. Reasons for not providing a genomic-driven treatment included absence of
      progressive disease (38%), investigator's choice (9%), rapid PD (19%), and no
      drug access (21%). Array CGH correctly identified Her2 status in 97% cases;
      failures were related to low % of tumour cells. Our study showed that array CGH
      is feasible in the context of daily practice and, in combination with PIK3CA/AKT1
      mutations, identifies a significant number of actionable molecular alterations
      that allow driving patients into specific targeted agents.

TI  - Prognostic impact of vitamin B6 metabolism in lung cancer.
PG  - 257-69
LID - 10.1016/j.celrep.2012.06.017 [doi]
AB  - Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are routinely treated with
      cytotoxic agents such as cisplatin. Through a genome-wide siRNA-based screen, we 
      identified vitamin B6 metabolism as a central regulator of cisplatin responses in
      vitro and in vivo. By aggravating a bioenergetic catastrophe that involves the
      depletion of intracellular glutathione, vitamin B6 exacerbates cisplatin-mediated
      DNA damage, thus sensitizing a large panel of cancer cell lines to apoptosis.
      Moreover, vitamin B6 sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis induction by distinct
      types of physical and chemical stress, including multiple chemotherapeutics. This
      effect requires pyridoxal kinase (PDXK), the enzyme that generates the bioactive 
      form of vitamin B6. In line with a general role of vitamin B6 in stress
      responses, low PDXK expression levels were found to be associated with poor
      disease outcome in two independent cohorts of patients with NSCLC. These results 
      indicate that PDXK expression levels constitute a biomarker for risk
      stratification among patients with NSCLC.

TI  - Phase II trial of PTK787/ZK 222584 (vatalanib) administered orally once-daily or 
      in two divided daily doses as second-line monotherapy in relapsed or progressing 
      patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
PG  - 678-87

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this multicenter, prospective uncontrolled phase II 
      trial was to determine efficacy, safety and tolerability of vatalanib, an oral
      angiogenesis inhibitor targeting all known vascular endothelial growth factor
      receptors, in the second-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC-proven tumor progression 
      during or after one platinum-based chemotherapy regimen received a fixed dose of 
      1250 mg vatalanib either once-daily dosing (QD) or two divided daily dosing (TDD:
      500 mg a.m. + 750 mg p.m.) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Primary end point was the disease control rate (DCR) at 12 weeks. RESULTS:
      Fifty-four and 58 patients were enrolled to the QD and TDD arms. DCR at 12 weeks 
      was 35% in the QD and 37% in the TDD arm. The best overall response included one 
      (2%) patient with confirmed partial response with QD and three (5%) with TDD.
      Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 2.1/7.3 months in the 
      QD arm and 2.8/9.0 months with TDD arm. This therapy showed a moderate toxicity
      profile for the majority of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In the chosen patient
      population, vatalanib QD and TDD dosing demonstrated potential benefits in tumor 
      size reduction, DCR, and survival.

TI  - Molecular Characteristics of ERCC1-Negative versus ERCC1-Positive Tumors in
      Resected NSCLC.
PG  - 5562-72
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0790 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) is a protein
      involved in repair of DNA platinum adducts and stalled DNA replication forks. We 
      and others have previously shown the influence of ERCC1 expression upon survival 
      rates and benefit of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with resected
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, little is known about the molecular 
      characteristics of ERCC1-positive and ERCC1-negative tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
      We took advantage of a cohort of 91 patients with resected NSCLC, for which we
      had matched frozen and paraffin-embedded samples to explore the comparative
      molecular portraits of ERCC1-positive and ERCC1-negative tumors of NSCLC. We
      carried out a global molecular analysis including assessment of ERCC1 expression 
      levels by using both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative reverse
      transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), genomic instability, global gene and miRNA
      expression, and sequencing of selected key genes involved in lung carcinogenesis.
      RESULTS: ERCC1 protein and mRNA expression were significantly correlated.
      However, we observed several cases with clear discrepancies. We noted that
      ERCC1-negative tumors had a higher rate of genomic abnormalities versus
      ERCC1-positive tumors. ERCC1-positive tumors seemed to share a common DNA damage 
      response (DDR) phenotype with the overexpression of seven genes linked to DDR.
      The miRNA expression analysis identified miR-375 as significantly underexpressed 
      in ERCC1-positive tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show inconsistencies in ERCC1
      expression between IHC and qRT-PCR readouts. Furthermore, ERCC1 status is not
      linked to specific mutational patterns or frequencies. Finally, ERCC1-negative
      tumors have a high rate of genomic aberrations that could consequently influence 
      prognosis in patients with resected NSCLC.

TI  - Alternatively spliced NKp30 isoforms affect the prognosis of gastrointestinal
      stromal tumors.
PG  - 700-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.2366 [doi]
AB  - The natural killer (NK) cell receptor NKp30 is involved in the recognition of
      tumor and dendritic cells (DCs). Here we describe the influence of three NKp30
      splice variants on the prognosis of gastrointestinal sarcoma (GIST), a malignancy
      that expresses NKp30 ligands and that is treated with NK-stimulatory KIT tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors. Healthy individuals and those with GIST show distinct patterns
      of transcription of functionally different NKp30 isoforms. In a retrospective
      analysis of 80 individuals with GIST, predominant expression of the
      immunosuppressive NKp30c isoform (over the immunostimulatory NKp30a and NKp30b
      isoforms) was associated with reduced survival of subjects, decreased
      NKp30-dependent tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and CD107a release, and
      defective interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) secretion in
      the NK-DC cross-talk that could be restored by blocking of IL-10. Preferential
      NKp30c expression resulted partly from a single-nucleotide polymorphism at
      position 3790 in the 3' untranslated region of the gene encoding NKp30. The
      genetically determined NKp30 status predicts the clinical outcomes of individuals
      with GIST independently from KIT mutation.
